
#  MEAN AND VARIANCE USING SCILAB

AIM: 

To write a program for mean, variance and cross correlation in SCILAB and verify the output. 
 
EQUIPMENTS Needed 
 
• Computer with i3 Processor 
• SCI LAB 
 
Algorithm 
1. Define the Function: Specify the function you want to simulate. For example, 
f(x)=sin  (x)f(x) = \sin(x)f(x)=sin(x) or any other function. 
2. Generate Sample Points: Decide on the range and the number of sample points. Generate 
these sample points within the desired range. 
3. Evaluate the Function: Compute the function values at each of these sample points. 
4. Compute Mean, Variance and Cross Correlation: Use Scilab's functions to calculate the 
mean and variance of the computed function values. 
5. Display Results: Output the computed mean variance and Cross Correlation

   
PROCEDURE:

• Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment. 
• Open SCILAB in System 
• Type your code in New Editor 
• Save the file 
• Execute the code 
• If any Error, correct it in code and execute again 
• Verify the generated results
